- error at app.rb:273 when retrieving from pandora api
- cover art doesn't load sometimes, need backup image or try again stuff
- favicon
- run multiple backends so multiuser not slow
- crossfade
- if someone adds a ton of songs, they shouldn't dominate the queue
- slightly longer notification
- if a pandora song has no cover_url use the artist cover
