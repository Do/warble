- error at app.rb:273 when retrieving from pandora api
- run multiple backends so multiuser not slow
- crossfade
- if someone adds a ton of songs, they shouldn't dominate the queue
- likes/hearts -- add to notification too, reset notification timer if hovered
- if connection reconnects, fetch everything from scratch in case we missed deltas while sleeping
- if queue refreshes while hovering on tooltip, the tooltip doesn't dissapear on mouseleave
- use these icons for services: http://www.alexpeattie.com/projects/justvector_icons/#license
- for hypem songs, after download, update artist and title from id3tag if better than existing
- if the player can't play a song, it should signal which marks the song as bad and puts in a review queue
- maybe for hypem songs that didn't meta properly, throw in queue for re-retrieival?

- More Services:
 - Rdio
 - Grooveshark
 - Youtube
 - Random web urls
